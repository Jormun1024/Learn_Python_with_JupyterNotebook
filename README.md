These are some of my experiences learning Python. I hope you can easily handle Python with them.</br>
I suggest starting with Basic Grammar.ipynb first.</br>
Then Stereotyped Writing.ipynb would be the best next step.</br>
If you have enough time, Practice.ipynb and Sort.ipynb are also useful.</br>
